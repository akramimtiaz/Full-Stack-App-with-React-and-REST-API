# techdegree-project-9

This project involves the creation of a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will allow users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

This project covers REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with the Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence. Testing was performed using the Postman application.

To run this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.
First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install
```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/]
