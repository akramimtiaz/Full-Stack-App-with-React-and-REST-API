# techdegree-project-10

This project uses React to create a client for the existing school database REST API (created in the previous project). The purpose of this full stack application is to provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will provide users with the ability to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. Lastly, this project covers the following topic areas: React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.
